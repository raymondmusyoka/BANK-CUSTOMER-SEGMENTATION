# BANK-CUSTOMER-SEGMENTATION
A project to show whether bank  customer is retained or exited based on the attributes associated with a bank customer.
# Bank Customer Segmentation

## Project Overview

This project aims to segment bank customers into distinct groups based on their financial behavior, demographics, and engagement patterns. The goal is to identify high-value customers, understand customer churn drivers, and tailor marketing strategies to specific customer segments.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project comprises information about bank customers, including their credit scores, geographical locations, genders, ages, tenures, account balances, product holdings, credit card ownership, membership status, estimated salaries, and churn status.

## Methodology

The project employs a data science pipeline encompassing data exploration, data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and model evaluation.

### Data Exploration

The initial phase involves exploring the data to understand its structure, identify patterns and trends, and assess data quality. This includes examining distributions of variables, checking for missing values, and detecting outliers.

### Data Cleaning

Data cleaning involves addressing data inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers to ensure data integrity and reliability. This may involve imputing missing values, removing outliers, and handling data inconsistencies.

### Feature Engineering

Feature engineering involves creating new features from existing data to enhance the predictive power of the models. This may involve deriving new variables from existing ones, aggregating data across different time periods, and encoding categorical variables.

### Model Training

Various machine learning algorithms are trained to segment customers based on their characteristics. Algorithms such as K-means clustering, decision trees, and random forests are employed to identify distinct customer segments.

### Model Evaluation

The performance of the trained models is evaluated using metrics such as silhouette score, accuracy, precision, and recall. The model with the best performance is selected for further analysis and interpretation.

## Project Outcomes

The project delivers insights into customer segmentation, churn prediction, and targeted marketing strategies. The segmentation model can be used to identify high-value customers, understand churn drivers, and tailor marketing campaigns to specific customer segments.

## Future Work

Potential future work includes:

* Investigating the impact of customer segmentation on marketing campaign effectiveness.
* Developing predictive models for customer churn.
* Exploring more sophisticated segmentation techniques, such as hierarchical clustering or latent Dirichlet allocation.
